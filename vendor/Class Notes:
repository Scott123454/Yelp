Class Notes:

restful: a set of best practices of how we build up url's using post, get, put/patch, delete

deals with collections and members of the collection by using urls such as

example.com/restaurants = collection
example.com/restaurants/Nandos = member of collection

enables us to update single restaurants or all restaurants


action and href are the same thing, they point to a url


IDEA:

Allow users to leave a review
You will be able to show many more providers than they will know of e.g Intertec, WSP
Need a provider to produce certificates



Adding users:

Use Devise for user sign up from Github

rails generate devise something look at devise readme.  required for to finish it??
